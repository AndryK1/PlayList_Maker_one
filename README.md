Hello and welcome to my test project!

This application is my practical learning ground for mastering Android development and Git. It's a music app designed for creating playlists and streaming audio.

Key technical features:

Architecture: Built on the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern and Clean Architecture principles for separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

Structure: Uses a single-Activity approach, where the main Activity serves as a container, and all UI screens are implemented as Fragments.

Asynchronous Operations: Handles network requests and database operations using Kotlin Coroutines for efficient and safe background execution.

Tech Stack: Utilizes modern Android development tools, including various Jetpack components.
